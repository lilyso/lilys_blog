# My CSS BFF

HTML gave me a simple foundation in my journey to becoming a developer. It followed me through my career in digital content manangement and marketing. In my early days, I saw it as some archaic language and I couldn't understand why I had to code in my blog styles when so many user-friendly editors were available at the time. It was time consuming, confusing and I had no interest in learning it.

And yet it kept following me. In the past year, I challenged myself to code a HTML email for work. I really had no idea what I was doing but it seemed logical enough. It was strangely satisfying to see everything come together. I started to realise that HTML wasn't archaic at all and it is basically the skeleton of digital world.

Long story short, after realising I hated working in marketing, I finally made the decision to go to coding school to embark on a new career path. I'm currently enrolled in the Sydney Uni Coding Bootcamp run by Trilogy and it has been intense but incredibly fulfilling. After working on some dodgy websites and using websites with terrible UX, coding school started to answer the questions I had for so many years, problems that I wish I could fix but had no idea how.

When CSS came along it was like putting on a pair of shoes that fit perfectly, especially when your feet are wider than most and one foot is a half size bigger than the other, this is a dream! And suddenly the possibilities were endless.

Learning CSS has been a good challenge and I can't quite describe the satisfaction I get when words, images, elements just snap into place, just the way you imagined. I'm still figuing out flexbox but it has been fun figuring it out.

However, it was never this easy or perfect. There are still many developers who hate CSS. Before Flexbox and Grid came onto the scene in 2009 and 2007 respectively, it was a struggle to get elements to fit resposively on the screen. And with so many screen sizes nowadays, it would have been so annoying. The only options were Float and Clear to offer some structure to image and text elements. I came into it at a good time where the know bugs with Flexbox had been resolved and more browsers were compatible. Grid still has moe compatibility issues than Flexbox but it's quickly becoming more popular.

> ## Flexbox Traps
>
> Here are some mistakes and misunderstandings I made with Flexbox as a newbie.
>
> 1. Flex containers by default are displayed horizontally.
>
> While divs are diplayed vertically by default, you will see your layout .change once you apply flex to your sections. In the beginning, I didn't plan my sections all too well and resorted to flexbox as a fix to have my page layout change completely due to the default.
>
> 2. The flex container will take up the minimum amount of space based on its content.
>
> I found lot of the tutorials misleading as the illusrated demonstrations showed perfect containers fitting perfectly on the page. It seems obvious now but it took me a while to understand the idea of available space and how to manipulate it using flex grow/shrink and space evenly/between along with the right padding and margins.
>
> 3. Centering
>
> I have spent too much time trying to center the content in a container. My misunderstanding of available space was my downfall. The problem was I that kept trying to center content when I had not allocated the container. It was like trying to put a box in the middle of a room but you're stuck in the hallway. Adding a div around the element and then centering will do the trick in most cases.

I'm looking forward to exploring some CSS frameworks that are meant to make design even more efficient!
